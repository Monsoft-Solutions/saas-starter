# PR Review Analyzer Agent

Expert agent for analyzing GitHub PR code reviews, determining actionable items, and creating comprehensive fix instructions following project guidelines and best practices.

## Overview

The PR Review Analyzer agent automatically processes GitHub PR comments, analyzes code changes, and creates structured documentation with specific fix instructions. It intelligently categorizes review feedback to help developers focus on the most important issues.

## Key Features

### üîç **Intelligent Analysis**

- Fetches PR comments and code changes using GitHub CLI
- Analyzes review feedback for actionability
- Categorizes issues by severity and priority
- Identifies which comments require developer action

### üìã **Action Classification**

- **CRITICAL**: Security issues, type errors, breaking changes
- **HIGH**: Performance issues, architectural problems, major bugs
- **MEDIUM**: Code quality, naming conventions, minor optimizations
- **LOW**: Style preferences, documentation improvements
- **INFO**: Suggestions that don't require action

### üìù **Structured Documentation**

- Creates comprehensive review documents in `/pr-reviews/`
- Includes metadata for automated processing
- Provides specific fix instructions with code examples
- Follows project coding standards and TypeScript best practices

## Usage Examples

### Basic PR Analysis

```bash
# Analyze a specific PR
Analyze PR #123 and create review documentation

# Focus on specific concerns
Analyze PR #456 focusing on TypeScript issues and security concerns

# Process multiple PRs
Process all open PRs and create review summaries
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

```bash
# After creating a PR, run analysis
gh pr create --title "Feature: Add user authentication"
# Then analyze the PR
Analyze PR #[number] and create review documentation
```

## Review Document Structure

### Metadata Schema

```yaml
pr_number: 123
pr_title: 'Feature: Add user authentication'
pr_author: 'developer@example.com'
reviewer: 'senior-dev@example.com'
analysis_date: '2025-01-01'
total_comments: 8
actionable_items: 5
critical_issues: 1
high_priority: 2
medium_priority: 2
low_priority: 0
requires_action: true
estimated_effort: '2-3 hours'
```

### Fix Instructions Format

Each actionable item includes:

- **Issue**: Clear description of the problem
- **Location**: File path and line numbers
- **Current Code**: Relevant code snippet
- **Problem**: Why it needs fixing
- **Solution**: Specific fix instructions
- **Code Example**: Before/after code samples
- **Guidelines**: Relevant project standards

## Example Output

### Critical Issue Example

````markdown
## CRITICAL: Type Safety Issue

**File**: `lib/auth/middleware.ts:45`
**Issue**: Missing null check for user session
**Current Code**:

```typescript
const user = session.user;
```
````

**Problem**: Potential runtime error if session is null
**Solution**: Add proper null checking
**Fixed Code**:

```typescript
const user = session?.user;
if (!user) {
  throw new Error('User not authenticated');
}
```

**Guidelines**: Follow TypeScript best practices for null safety

````

### Medium Priority Example
```markdown
## MEDIUM: Naming Convention

**File**: `components/ui/button.tsx:12`
**Issue**: Variable name doesn't follow camelCase convention
**Current Code**:
```typescript
const button_variant = 'primary';
````

**Solution**: Use camelCase naming
**Fixed Code**:

```typescript
const buttonVariant = 'primary';
```

**Guidelines**: Follow TypeScript naming conventions from project standards

````

## Analysis Criteria

### Requires Action
- ‚úÖ Type errors or compilation issues
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ Performance bottlenecks
- ‚úÖ Breaking changes
- ‚úÖ Code that violates project standards
- ‚úÖ Missing error handling
- ‚úÖ Incomplete implementations

### No Action Required

- ‚ùå Subjective code style differences

## Integration Points

### GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# Get PR details and comments
gh pr view <number> --json comments,reviews,title,author

# Get PR diff
gh pr diff <number>

# List open PRs
gh pr list --state open --json number,title,author
````

### Project Standards

- TypeScript best practices
- Code organization guidelines
- Design system standards
- Database schema conventions
- Security best practices

## Workflow Integration

### 1. **PR Creation**

```bash
# Create PR
gh pr create --title "Feature: Add new functionality"

# Get PR number and analyze
Analyze PR #[number] and create review documentation
```

### 2. **Review Processing**

- Agent fetches PR comments and code changes
- Analyzes each comment for actionability
- Categorizes issues by priority
- Creates structured documentation

### 3. **Fix Implementation**

- Developer reviews the analysis document
- Implements fixes based on specific instructions
- Updates PR with changes
- Re-runs analysis if needed

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All critical issues identified and documented
- [ ] Fix instructions are specific and actionable
- [ ] Code examples follow project standards
- [ ] Metadata is accurate and complete
- [ ] Non-actionable items are clearly marked
- [ ] File paths and line numbers are correct

### Error Handling

- Handles missing or inaccessible PRs gracefully
- Provides fallback guidance for unclear comments
- Flags items requiring manual review
- Requests clarification when needed

## Performance Considerations

- Processes large PRs efficiently
- Caches frequently accessed project standards
- Optimizes GitHub API calls
- Provides progress indicators for long analyses

## Security Guidelines

- Never exposes sensitive data in review documents
- Sanitizes code snippets before documentation
- Validates file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Uses secure GitHub CLI authentication

## Integration with Other Agents

- **software-engineer**: For complex code fixes
- **typescript**: For type-related issues
- **database-optimizer**: For database-related problems
- **ui-ux-designer**: For UI/UX review items

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Correctly identifies actionable vs non-actionable items
- **Completeness**: Addresses all review comments appropriately
- **Clarity**: Provides clear, specific fix instructions
- **Consistency**: Follows project standards in all recommendations
- **Efficiency**: Processes PRs quickly while maintaining quality

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Review Analysis First**: Always read the analysis document before making changes
2. **Follow Instructions**: Implement fixes exactly as specified
3. **Verify Changes**: Test fixes before updating PR
4. **Update Status**: Mark items as resolved in the analysis document

### For Reviewers

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable feedback
2. **Include Context**: Explain why changes are needed
3. **Reference Standards**: Point to relevant project guidelines
4. **Prioritize Issues**: Focus on critical and high-priority items first

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **PR not found**: Verify PR number and repository access
- **Missing comments**: Check if PR has been reviewed
- **Invalid file paths**: Ensure file paths are correct in comments
- **Unparseable code**: Flag for manual review

### Solutions

- Request additional information from user
- Provide general guidance when specific fixes unclear
- Create summary with known issues
- Escalate to appropriate specialist agent
