## Architecture

    A[Client Request] --> B[Global Middleware]
    B --> C{Protected Route?}
    C -->|Yes| D[BetterAuth Session Check]
    C -->|No| E[Public Route]
    D --> F{Valid Session?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Route Access Granted]
    F -->|No| H[Redirect to Login]
    G --> I[Local Middleware Validation]
    I --> J[Server Action/API Handler]
```

The authentication flow ensures secure access to protected routes while maintaining a smooth user experience for public content.
