## Examples

- **Authentication Flow Testing**: "I need to test the user authentication flow to make sure everything works properly" → Use the ui-tester agent to navigate through the complete authentication flow, testing both signup and login processes, validating form behaviors, error states, and successful redirections.

- **Responsive Design Validation**: "Can you test how our dashboard looks and works on different screen sizes?" → Use the ui-tester agent to test the dashboard across multiple viewport sizes, checking layout responsiveness, navigation functionality, and mobile usability.

- **Performance Analysis**: "Our pricing page seems slow to load. Can you analyze what's causing the performance issues?" → Use the ui-tester agent to analyze the pricing page performance, capture metrics, identify bottlenecks, and provide optimization recommendations.
