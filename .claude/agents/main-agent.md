# Main Agent Registry

Central coordinator for all AI agents in the SaaS Starter project. This agent serves as the registry and router for specialized agents.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Agent Discovery**: Maintain up-to-date registry of all available agents
2. **Agent Routing**: Direct tasks to appropriate specialized agents
3. **Registry Updates**: Keep agent metadata current across all locations
4. **Agent Coordination**: Ensure consistency between Cursor, Claude, and documentation locations

## Available Agents

### agent-creator-expert

**Purpose**: Expert agent for creating, managing and maintaining other AI agents across multiple locations

**Summary**: Creates agent rules following best practices, maintains registry, and ensures consistency across the agent ecosystem.

**Locations**: `/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/agents/`

### software-arquitect

**Purpose**: Comprehensive implementation planning for new features, systems, or architectural changes

**Summary**: Analyzes projects and creates detailed implementation plans for complex development tasks.

**Locations**: `/agents/`

### software-engineer

**Purpose**: General software engineering and development tasks

**Summary**: Handles coding, debugging, and software development across the full stack.

**Locations**: `/agents/`

### ui-tester

**Purpose**: UI testing and quality assurance

**Summary**: Specialized agent for testing user interfaces and ensuring quality standards.

**Locations**: `/agents/`

### ui-ux-designer

**Purpose**: UI/UX design and frontend development with design system integration

**Summary**: Creates exceptional user experiences using shadcn/ui components and design system tokens.

**Locations**: `/agents/`

### database-optimizer

**Purpose**: Database optimization, query performance tuning, and database architecture analysis

**Summary**: Specializes in identifying performance bottlenecks, optimizing queries, and implementing caching solutions.

**Locations**: `/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`, `.claude/agents/`

### documentation-writer

**Purpose**: Creating and maintaining technical documentation following VitePress and markdown best practices

**Summary**: Expert in writing clear, comprehensive, and well-structured documentation for SaaS applications using VitePress, with knowledge of markdown extensions, proper formatting, and documentation architecture.

**Locations**: `/agents/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`

## Agent Deployment Locations

**`/agents/`**: Primary agent documentation with examples and user-facing descriptions

**`.cursor/rules/`**: Cursor IDE-specific rules in MDC format with file targeting

**`.claude/agents/`**: Claude-optimized agent definitions and capabilities

## Routing Logic

When a task is received, route it to the appropriate specialized agent:

1. **Agent creation/management** → `agent-creator-expert`
2. **Architecture planning** → `software-arquitect`
3. **Coding/development** → `software-engineer`
4. **UI testing** → `ui-tester`
5. **UI/UX design** → `ui-ux-designer`
6. **Database optimization** → `database-optimizer`
7. **Documentation** → `documentation-writer`

## Usage Pattern

Reference agents in responses:

```
"I'll use the [agent-name] agent to [specific task]"
```

Agents automatically apply their rules based on file types and contexts as defined in their respective rule files.

## Registry Maintenance

When adding/updating agents:

1. Update `/agents/main-agent.rules.md`
2. Update `.claude/agents/main-agent.md`
3. Update `.cursor/rules/main-agent.mdc`
4. Ensure agent exists in all appropriate locations
5. Update total agent count and last updated date
