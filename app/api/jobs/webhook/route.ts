 * Supported webhook sources:
 * - stripe: Stripe payment and subscription webhooks
 * - resend: Email delivery status and bounce notifications
 * - custom: Custom webhook integrations
 *
 * @route POST /api/jobs/webhook
 * @description Processes webhook events asynchronously with retry logic (TODO: implementation)
