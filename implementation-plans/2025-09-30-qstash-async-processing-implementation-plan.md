# QStash Async Processing System Implementation Plan

**Created:** September 30, 2025
**Status:** Completed
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 5-7 days
**Complexity:** Medium

## Executive Summary

This implementation plan outlines the development of a comprehensive async job processing system using Upstash QStash for the SaaS starter application. The system provides reliable background job processing for email sending, webhook processing, data exports, report generation, and other async operations. The architecture is optimized for Next.js 15 serverless deployment with an extensible job worker pattern that allows easy addition of new job types.

## Implementation Notes

The actual implementation may differ from the original plan in terms of file locations and specific implementation details. The core architecture and patterns described below remain valid. Refer to the actual codebase for current file structure:

- Job types and schemas: `/lib/types/jobs/`
- Job services: `/lib/jobs/`
- Job worker endpoints: `/app/api/jobs/`
- Database schemas: `/lib/db/schemas/`
- Tests: `/tests/jobs/`

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Existing Infrastructure

- Configure retry policies, delays, and callbacks
- Set appropriate headers for content type and custom metadata

**2. Worker Endpoint (Process)**
- Verify QStash signature for security
- Parse and validate job payload
- Execute business logic
- Return appropriate HTTP status (200 for success, 5xx for retry)

**3. Scheduling (CRON)**
- Create scheduled jobs using CRON expressions
- Configure destination URL and payload
- Set timezone-aware schedules as needed

### Job Type Registry Pattern

Extensible job type system using a registry pattern:

**Job Type Enumeration:**
- Define all job types as const object
- Export type-safe JobType union type
- Centralize job type definitions for maintainability

**Job Configuration:**
- Create JobConfig interface with type, endpoint, retries, timeout, description
- Build registry mapping each job type to its configuration
- Provide getter function for type-safe config access

**Registry Structure:**
- Email jobs: 3 retries, 30s timeout
- Webhook jobs: 5 retries, 60s timeout
- Export jobs: 2 retries, 300s timeout
- Report jobs: 2 retries, 180s timeout
- Cleanup jobs: 1 retry, 600s timeout

### Job Payload Schema System

Type-safe job payloads using Zod:

**Base Job Schema:**
- Define BaseJobMetadata with userId, organizationId, createdAt, idempotencyKey
- Create BaseJob schema with jobId (UUID), type, metadata
- Enable type inference for all schemas

**Job-Specific Schemas:**
- Extend BaseJob for each job type
- Use literal type for job type discrimination
- Define payload structure with proper validation
- Include template enums where applicable
- Validate email addresses, URLs, and other formats

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Job Execution Metrics:**
   - Jobs enqueued per hour/day
   - Jobs completed successfully
   - Jobs failed (by type)
   - Average execution time
   - Retry rate

2. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Queue depth
   - Processing latency
   - Time to first retry
   - Dead letter queue size

3. **Error Metrics:**
   - Failed job rate by type
   - Common error messages
   - Jobs in DLQ
   - Signature verification failures

### Logging Strategy

**Job Lifecycle Events:**

```
[jobs] Enqueueing job: {type} (jobId: {id})
[jobs] Job enqueued successfully: {type} (jobId: {id})
[jobs] Processing job: {type} (jobId: {id})
[jobs] Job completed successfully: {type} (jobId: {id})
[jobs] Job failed: {type} (jobId: {id}, error: {message})
```

### QStash Dashboard

Access at: https://console.upstash.com/qstash

Monitor:

- Message throughput
- Delivery success rate
- Retry statistics
- DLQ items
- Scheduled jobs

## Security Considerations

### Request Signature Verification

Security requirements for job worker endpoints:
- Verify QStash signature on every request
- Use Receiver with current and next signing keys
- Reject requests with invalid signatures (401 status)
- Extract signature from Upstash-Signature header
- Validate against request body

### Payload Validation

Data validation requirements:
- Parse all job payloads with Zod schemas
- Validate at the boundary (worker endpoint)
- Return appropriate errors for invalid payloads
- Log validation failures
- Never process unvalidated data

### Environment Variables

Secret management guidelines:
- Store QStash credentials in environment variables only
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Rotate signing keys periodically
- Use different QStash projects for staging/production
- Validate environment variables at startup

## Cost Optimization

### QStash Pricing (as of 2025)

- First 500 messages/day: Free
- $1 per 100,000 messages after free tier
- Included with Upstash Redis paid plans

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch Operations:**
   - Group related operations when possible
   - Use single job for multiple emails (with caution)

2. **Smart Retries:**
   - Don't retry user errors (4xx)
   - Use exponential backoff
   - Set max retry limits

3. **Efficient Scheduling:**
   - Use appropriate CRON intervals
   - Avoid overlapping scheduled jobs
   - Monitor scheduled job execution time

## Future Enhancements

## Migration Guide

### Migrating Existing Sync Operations to Async

**Pattern for Migration:**

Synchronous approach (blocks HTTP request):
- Database operation followed by immediate email send
- User waits for email service response
- Failures in email service affect user experience

Asynchronous approach (non-blocking):
- Database operation followed by job enqueue
- Job enqueue is fast (<50ms)
- Email processing happens in background
- User gets immediate response
- Automatic retries on failure

**Key Changes:**
- Replace direct email dispatcher calls with enqueueEmailJob
- Pass template name and data to job payload
- Include user context in metadata
- Remove await on email sending (job enqueue is fast enough to await)

### Gradual Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Create Async Variants**
- Keep existing synchronous functions
- Create new async variants with "Async" suffix
- Test async variants in parallel with sync versions
- Monitor job execution and success rates

**Phase 2: Migrate Non-Critical Paths**
- Update background notifications to async
- Migrate audit emails to job queue
- Convert analytics updates to async
- Monitor performance and reliability

**Phase 3: Migrate Critical Paths**
- Update user onboarding emails after validation
- Migrate payment notifications with extra monitoring
- Convert security alerts to async with alerting
- Maintain fallback mechanisms during transition

**Phase 4: Remove Sync Variants**
- Mark sync functions as deprecated
- Update all remaining call sites
- Remove deprecated code
- Update documentation

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a production-ready async job processing system optimized for serverless deployment. The extensible architecture allows easy addition of new job types, and the QStash integration ensures reliable delivery with automatic retries.
